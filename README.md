# Colors Everywhere
Colors Everywhere gives you the ability to paint/dye floors, walls, fences, gates, chests, armor, and much more! Three new flowers have been added to support pigmentations. Search around for the Cornflower, Rose, and Sunflower!

## Overview
I encourage you to explore and look at your crafting section to find the new items.

* Paintbrushes
* Paint Remover (Brush coated with Ectoplasm)
* Full gamut of color pigments
* Dye bowls to be used with equipment
* Cornflower (Blue)
* Rose (Red)
* Sunflower (Yellow)
* Some items can be dismantled for other pigments directly

I will add some more screenshots when I can.

## Bugs
Please reach out to me on Steam or post a message on the workshop page if there are any issues.
